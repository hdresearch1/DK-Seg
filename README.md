# Dense Visual Descriptions for Segmentation Benchmarks

This repository provides **structured textual descriptions** (dense semantic knowledge) for each category in four widely used image segmentation benchmarks:

- [COIFT](https://github.com/hdresearch1/DK-Seg)
- [DIS5K](https://github.com/hdresearch1/DK-Seg)
- [ThinObject-5K](https://github.com/hdresearch1/DK-Seg)
- [MS-COCO](https://cocodataset.org/)

These descriptions are designed to support **multimodal learning**, especially in tasks involving **vision-language segmentation**, **semantic grounding**, **zero-shot segmentation**, and **knowledge-enhanced encoder training**.
